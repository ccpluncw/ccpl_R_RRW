\arguments{
\item{data}{This is a dataframe that must contain the following columns: overlap; RT (often a median); the proportion correct/incorrect; whether or not the row specifies a correct or incorrect trial. The dataset can also contains columns that effect code the influence of different parameters.}

\item{RWkeepColumns}{A vector of strings that specify the columns of the RRW simulated data that should be kept when the simulated dataframe is merged with the empirical dataframe.}

\item{mergeByDataColumns}{A vector of strings that specify the columns of the empirical data that should be used in the "by.x" option of the merge() function when the simulated dataframe is merged with the empirical dataframe.}

\item{mergeByRWColumns}{A vector of strings that specify the columns of the RRW simulated data that should be used in the "by.y" option of the merge() function when the simulated dataframe is merged with the empirical dataframe.}

\item{dataRtCol}{A string that identifies the name of the column in data that contains the RTs for the specific overlap/correct/condition combination. Default is "rt"}

\item{RwSamplesCol}{A string that identifies the name of the column in the RRW simulations that contains the summary of the samples that you want to use as a simulation for RT.  The possible columns are: "Q25" (the 25th quartile); "Q50" (the median); "mean" (the mean); "Q75" (the 75th quartile).  The default is "Q50" because the median is more robust than the mean.}

\item{dataOverlapCol}{A string that identifies the name of the column in data that contains the distributional overlaps for each row.}

\item{b}{A vector of number(s) specifying the boundary distance from a 0 startpoint. If the number of values is greater than 1, then each value must have a corresponding effect coded column in the dataset. These columns should be effect coded, because the values contained in this column will be multiplied by the value of b. The column names must be specified in the "bCols" argument. b is specific to the RRW simulation and has no default value}

\item{startValue}{A vector of signed number(s) between -1 and 1 that indicates the position of the start point as a proportion of the boundary value.   If the number of values is greater than 1, then each value must have a corresponding effect coded column in the dataset. These columns should be effect coded, because the values contained in this column will be multiplied by the value of startValue. The column names must be specified in the "sCols" argument. startValue = 0 is the default and represents an unbiased start point.}

\item{noiseSD}{A vector of positive number(s) representing the SD of the noise distribution.  The noise distribution is N(0,nSD) and is added to the value of every step.  If the number of values is greater than 1, then each value must have a corresponding effect coded column in the dataset. These columns should be effect coded, because the values contained in this column will be multiplied by the value of noiseSD. The column names must be specified in the "nSDCols" argument. noiseSD = 0 is the default and represents no noise being added to each step.}

\item{decayBeta}{A vector of signed number(s) representing the beta value in the Information Accrual Bias (IAB).  If the number of values is greater than 1, then each value must have a corresponding effect coded column in the dataset. These columns should be effect coded, because the values contained in this column will be multiplied by the value of decayBeta. The column names must be specified in the "dbCols" argument. decayBeta = 0 is the default and represents no IAB.}

\item{decayAsymptote}{A vector of positive number(s) representing the asymptote value in the Information Accrual Bias (IAB).  If the number of values is greater than 1, then each value must have a corresponding effect coded column in the dataset. These columns should be effect coded, because the values contained in this column will be multiplied by the value of decayAsymptote. The column names must be specified in the "daCols" argument. decayAsymptote = 0.2 is the default.}

\item{valueChange}{A vector of signed number(s) that indicates the change of overlap that one predicts. If the number of values is greater than 1, then each value must have a corresponding effect coded column in the dataset. These columns should be effect coded, because the values contained in this column will be multiplied by the value of valueChange. The column names must be specified in the "vcCols" argument. The default is 0 because there is no valueChangeEffect.}

\item{bCols}{A vector of strings that identifies the name(s) of the column in data that identifies the conditions that will affect the change of boundary (b).  These columns should be effect coded, because the values contained in this column will be multiplied by the value of b.}

\item{sCols}{A vector of strings that identifies the name(s) of the column in data that identifies the conditions that will affect the change of startValue (startValue).  These columns should be effect coded, because the values contained in this column will be multiplied by the value of startValue.}

\item{nSDCols}{A vector of strings that identifies the name(s) of the column in data that identifies the conditions that will affect the change of noiseSD (noiseSD).  These columns should be effect coded, because the values contained in this column will be multiplied by the value of noiseSD.}

\item{dbCols}{A vector of strings that identifies the name(s) of the column in data that identifies the conditions that will affect the change of decayBeta (decayBeta).  These columns should be effect coded, because the values contained in this column will be multiplied by the value of decayBeta.}

\item{daCols}{A vector of strings that identifies the name(s) of the column in data that identifies the conditions that will affect the change of decay asymptote (decayAsymptote).  These columns should be effect coded, because the values contained in this column will be multiplied by the value of decayAsymptote.}

\item{vcCols}{A vector of strings that identifies the name(s) of the column in data that identifies the conditions that will affect the change of value change (valueChange).  These columns should be effect coded, because the values contained in this column will be multiplied by the value of overlap.}

\item{loops}{A number specifying the number of loops that will be run in the RRW simulation when it calculates the summary statistics for each number of samples for each boundary. Higher numbers produce more precise estimates, but also increase the time needed to converge on a solution.  Default is 200.}
}
\value{
A dataframe that contains the "data" plus the fitted values from the model ("Q25" (the 25th quartile); "Q50" (the median); "mean" (the mean); "Q75" (the 75th quartile); pCross (the fitted pHit from the model - probability of crossing each boundary); rtFit (the fitted rt values from the model))
}
\description{
This function simulates the RRW for a single set of parameters across all values of overlap and then attaches this simulation to the empirical RT and error data.  This simulation's fit will be assessed by the optimization program (using assessRRWfit()) and then the parameters will be adjested.
